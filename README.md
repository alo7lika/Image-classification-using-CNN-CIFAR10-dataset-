# Image Classification using CNN (CIFAR10 Dataset)

## Overview
The Image Classification project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images from the CIFAR10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes. This project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs in handling image classification tasks.

## Features
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Can classify images into 10 distinct categories.
- **Visualization Tools**: These include tools for visualizing training metrics and predictions.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Option to use transfer learning with popular architectures like VGG16 and ResNet.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
